        <h4>Traditional Brazilian black beans (feijoada) can take quite some time to prepare. Considering I spend most of my time chasing after 2 small children, I've come up with this recipe for a very quick feijoada. This goes very well with white rice.</h4>
        <h3>Necessary Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 strips bacon, diced</li>
            <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
            <li>½ cup minced green bell pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, drained</li>
            <li>½ cup chicken broth, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vinegar</li>
            <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 dash hot sauce to taste (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Necessary Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook bacon in a pot over medium heat until almost crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Add onion and green pepper to the bacon; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix in cilantro, garlic, and bay leaf; cook and stir until flavors combine, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir beans, chicken broth, vinegar, salt, pepper, and hot sauce into the onion mixture; cover and let simmer until the flavors combine, 10 to 15 minutes. Add more chicken broth if you would like the beans to be more soupy.</li>
        </ol>
